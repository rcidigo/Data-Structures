#TreeMap

Requirement:
Project 2 required that I implement my own version of the class Tree-map using one of two methods:
Either a standard Binary Search Tree using the pseudo code you provided, or implement a self-adjusting
tree or Splay Tree. I decided however to use the Binary Search Tree method instead. Assuming all goes
well with the chosen implementation, we would then integrate our newly created Tree-map class and use
it as a replacement for the provided Tree-map we used in Project 1. The end game is for there not to be a
difference in output between either implementation.


Method:
For this program we were asked implement our own Tree-map class and I decided to proceed with
creating a Binary Search Tree. You provided a Tree-map shell containing methods such as delete, insert,

search etc. Also you provided a tree class that we would use to complement our own version of the Tree-
map. To succeed in creating a Tree-map we needed to carefully and constructively implement each of the

methods your provided in your shell. So one by one I carefully went over the logic and scenarios for each
method to come up with the pseudo code. Also drew diagrams that really helped bring the point across.
